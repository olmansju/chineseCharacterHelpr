# Setup
## Repository
As you see, the repository for this web application is on Github. If you would like to contribute please feel free to branch the project and use it for your purposes. If you feel your code can contibute please do not hesitate to submit a pull request to upload your changes or contact Justin at jolmanson2@unl.edu.
## Modules
The components for this project were set up with Node.js. You can download the latest node.js and then from a command window (cmd on windows or terminal on mac) in administrator navigate out to the site project and type "npm install" this will install all node projects automatically. The projcts are not synced with github because the complex directory tree can cause issues with some operating systems. That and the files should not need to be modified so there is no need to share changes. If that is needed we can explore that.
## CSS compiling
I also use gruntjs as a SASS preprocessor to CSS. This allows for the organiztion of our styling and will greatly aid in making this site responsive.
Install Ruby Sass - in order to compile SASS you will need Ruby installed. Install it here
http://sass-lang.com/install

Afterwards run this command in your terminal/command prompt.
gem install sass

## File structure
This I will type of later, will largely depend on whether we use angular.

#Special Thanks
