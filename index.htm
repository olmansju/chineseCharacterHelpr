    <p>Above is a box where you type the word and it displays the options and you can chose one to go in the box by typing the correlating number. This is the functionality I need to break so the output goes into an array which is automatically updated.</p>
    <p>Below are some examples of the word 猫 from different voices, ideally I want it to work with a function (the last one) but that is broken at the moment.</p>
    <input type="button" value="Chinese Female" onclick="responsiveVoice.speak('猫', 'Chinese Female')">
    <input type="button" value="Chinese (Hong Kong) Female" onclick="responsiveVoice.speak('猫', 'Chinese (Hong Kong) Female')">
    <input type="button" value="Chinese Taiwan Female" onclick="responsiveVoice.speak('猫', 'Chinese Taiwan Female')">
    <input type="button" value="play from function" onclick="myResponsiveVoice('猫')">
    <p>The app will require dozens of hours of styling and functionality but all the pieces are there except the images... I need to invest a few hours into looking into APIs. I sent out some feelers but haven't gotten much from people.</p>
